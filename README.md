# Mini Shy Bot

![Photo of the Shy Bot](IMG_4204.jpg?raw=true "I'm a very nice bot that just wants to be left alone.")

Inspired by Norma Jeane's [ShyBot](http://codame.com/projects/shybot), this Mini Shy Bot is a simple motion-activated bot that will run away from you when you walk into a room.

It's built with [SparkFun's RedBot Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649), an extensible Arduino based bot platform that's great for experiments.
